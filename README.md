# Indus Valley Script.

An exploration of the mysterious script of the Indus Valley Civilization. It has not yet been deciphered, and much work remains to be done to get there. By making this script more easily available on the web, it is hoped that scholars and enthusiasts alike will be able to make some headway toward this end. In any case, if more people gain awareness about this lost civilization, then we have been successful.
